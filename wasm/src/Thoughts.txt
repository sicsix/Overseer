  INTEREST MAPS LINKING WITH UTILITY AI
  SQUAD SYSTEM
  SQUAD LEADER INFLUENCE MAPS -> may need a full map for each squad OR give the commander a larger and strong proximity radius?
  BASIC COMMAND SYSTEM
  BASIC CREEP AI
  BASIC SL AI
  BASIC COMMANDER AI

Three levels of decision making:

Overseer - Strategic Commander
Responsible for:
Analysing overall map state to create orders from
Prioritising squad leader requests?
Creating squads
  Squad size
  Squad makeup
  Depending on goals?

Operating towers
  Heal
  Attack

Commanding squads
  Reserve
  Defend
  Attack group
  Attack building
  Attack creep
  Capture
  Reinforce (join group)
  Gather?
  Potentially - behaviour - Careless, reckless, aggressive, careful, neutral?




Squad Leader - Tactical Commander
  Carrying out orders
  Maintaining squad cohesiveness
  Retreating
  Calling for reinforcements
  Calling priority targets for attack or healing
  Requesting heals?
  Passing leadership?

  Maintains formation, use some sort of pathfinding proximity map of leader to show positions good to move to

  Squad states ->   Engaged (if anyone in squad has done/received damage is past x tics)
                    Fleeing (running at top speed in a general safe direction ie towards base or towards friendly group, or a targeted location, ignores stragglers)
                    Withdrawing (steady withdrawal, maintaining cohesiveness)
  Squad behaviour -> CAREFUL AWARE RECKLESS


Also note:
  Need to make sure we mark the location where prior creeps in the turn have opted to move to so it is blocked from being chosen by the next creep
  Need to write interest map, need to add tower threat, need to add special leader proximity influence
  Maybe start with squad system?

Creeps - Invidiual AI
  Following squad leader
  Attacking, Ranged Attack, Heal etc as required
  Positioning within squad leader radius to accomplish goals based on behaviour
  Move to better location

  Creep behaviour -> AVOID, ENGAGE, RECKLESS, inherits from squad unless overridden

  Sample AI:
  Movement
    AER Manouver -> get closer to prioritised target or location, or closer to enemy, CAR determines how much personal safety matters
    AER FollowSquadLeader -> if squad leader out of range or too far away, avoid enemies if near, manouver towards squad leaders position. if reckless do not avoid enemies
    A Flee -> Too damaged/outnumbered, must be ordered from above, or invidual can choose if Careful, will flee towards base/squad leader/friendly groups
    AE Withdrawal -> move to a safer place and wait for heals, avoid enemy contact, tries to find safe space behind friendlys, could be more likely to do if movement is threatened
    AER Evade/RangedAttack/RangedHeal -> try and maintain buffer by keeping to lower threat zones, while still being in range to attack/heal, CAR determines how much risk taken to hit prioritised target

  Attack/Heal
    Attack -> prioritises targets that are marked, followed by target in lowest threat area ie more surrounded

    RangedHeal -> Prioritise targets that are more surrounded and/or low health
    Heal -> choose between rangeheal/heal, and which target to heal

    RangedMassAttack -> Prioritise over RangedAttack if damage outcome better, only go against this rule if behaviour is reckless and priority is in range

    Notes:  Attack + RangedHeal
            Attack + RangedAttack
            Attack + RangedMassAttack
            RangedAttack + Heal
            RangedMassAttack + Heal
